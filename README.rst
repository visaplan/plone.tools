visaplan.plone.tools
====================

General tools modules for Plone.

We don't claim ultimate Plone wisdom (yet); the main purpose of this package is
to factor out functionality from a big monolithic product into packages.

Thus, the purpose of this package (for now) is *not* to provide new functionality;
it is more likely to loose functionality during further development
(as parts of it will be forked out into their own packages,
or some functionality may even become obsolete because there are better
alternatives in standard Plone components).

It is part of the footing of the "Unitracc family" of Plone sites
which are maintained by visaplan GmbH, Bochum, Germany.

Some modules of this package still contain some resources (e.g. type names)
which are specific to our "Unitracc family" of sites;
this is likely to change in future releases.

    eggs =

and then running ``bin/buildout``
